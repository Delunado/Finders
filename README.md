### What's "Finders!" about?
Finders! is a genetic algorithms simulation using Unity. 

You can create a map using different blocks. Then, a generation of little creatures will be created. They try to go from the start point to the final point, learning through generations. After some generations, the creatures should know how to reach the final point evading the obstacles.

## Try It!
You can download the build for Windows [here](https://github.com/Delunado/Finders/raw/master/Try%20It/Finders!.zip) or try it in your browser [here](https://delunado.itch.io/finders-genethic-algorithm). 

*Important: the browser version may run slower when using high numbers because of some heavy operations.*
